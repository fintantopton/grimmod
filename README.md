# GrimMod: Mod Loader for Grim Fandango Remastered

Download at [https://hexagon.codes/grimhd](https://hexagon.codes/grimhd)

## Features

* **Mods**
  - Allows for the creation of asset mods that can swap out any file usually loaded from the game's .LAB datapacks.
* **High-Quality Assets**
  - Upgrades the renderer to support high-quality assets with any resolution and 32-bit color. Without this, assets are max 640x480 with dithered 24-bit color.
* **Forced VSync**
  - Previously, the remaster didn't use vsync while in-game and produced frames as fast as it could (sometimes causing coil whine).
* **High-DPI Fix** (Windows/macOS)
  - On high-dpi systems with UI scaling above 100%, the remaster renders at a lower resolution and lets the system scale it up. This isn't that noticeable with 640x480 backgrounds but it stops high-quality assets from displaying at their full resolution. GrimMod forces the game to always render at the window's actual resolution.
* **Quick Renderer Toggle**
  - In the remaster, toggling the renderer between Original/Remastered is a smooth transition which makes changes less noticeable. GrimMod makes the toggle instant, highlighting the differences between the renderers.

## Installation

### Windows

1. Place `glu32.dll` in the root of the Grim Fandango Remastered directory where `GrimFandango.exe` is located.
2. (Optional) Put any mods in a `Mods` folder in the root directory.
3. Enjoy the ride!

Note: For GOG on Windows, when launching with the "Launch Grim Fandango Remastered" shortcut (like GOG Galaxy does), it's necessary to locate the shortcut in the game folder and set "Properties -> Compatibility -> Run this program as an administrator".

Note: For the Steam Deck, first set the game to run the Windows version by using Proton in the compatibility options.

### macOS

The macOS version works with the App Store/GOG build of Grim Fandango Remastered. It runs under Rosetta 2 on Apple Silicon Macs.

**Step 1: Place the library**

Copy `libgrimmod.dylib` into the app bundle's `MacOS` directory:
```bash
cp libgrimmod.dylib "/Applications/Grim Fandango Remastered.app/Contents/MacOS/"
```

**Step 2: Re-sign the game binary**

The game binary ships with a hardened runtime signature that blocks library injection. You need to re-sign it with entitlements that allow `DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES`.

Create an `entitlements.plist` file:
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
    <key>com.apple.security.cs.allow-dyld-environment-variables</key>
    <true/>
    <key>com.apple.security.cs.disable-library-validation</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
</plist>
```

Back up and re-sign the binary:
```bash
APP="/Applications/Grim Fandango Remastered.app/Contents/MacOS"
cp "$APP/GrimFandango" "$APP/GrimFandango.original"
codesign --force --sign - --entitlements entitlements.plist --deep "$APP/GrimFandango"
```

**Step 3: Install the launcher wrapper**

Rename the game binary and create a wrapper script so grimmod loads automatically when you launch the app:
```bash
APP="/Applications/Grim Fandango Remastered.app/Contents/MacOS"
mv "$APP/GrimFandango" "$APP/GrimFandango.real"
cat > "$APP/GrimFandango" << 'EOF'
#!/bin/bash
DIR="$(dirname "$0")"
export DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES="$DIR/libgrimmod.dylib"
exec "$DIR/GrimFandango.real" "$@"
EOF
chmod +x "$APP/GrimFandango"
```

The game will now load grimmod automatically when launched from Finder, Dock, Spotlight, or the command line.

**Step 4: Install mods (optional)**

Place mod folders in the app bundle's `Resources` directory:
```bash
cp -r <mod-folder> "/Applications/Grim Fandango Remastered.app/Contents/Resources/Mods/"
```

**Step 5: Configure (optional)**

Create a `grimmod.toml` in the `Resources` directory to configure options (see [Config](#config)):
```bash
cp grimmod.toml "/Applications/Grim Fandango Remastered.app/Contents/Resources/"
```

**Uninstalling**: To restore the original game, remove the wrapper and rename the binary back:
```bash
APP="/Applications/Grim Fandango Remastered.app/Contents/MacOS"
rm "$APP/GrimFandango" "$APP/libgrimmod.dylib"
mv "$APP/GrimFandango.real" "$APP/GrimFandango"
```

## Changelog

  - Fixed 64-bit struct layouts for `RenderPassEntity`, `Draw`, `Surface`, `ImageContainer`, `Image`, and `ImageAttributes`.
  - Fixed `draw_indexed_primitives` parameter truncation on 64-bit (index buffer pointer).
  - Fixed `copy_image` parameter truncation on 64-bit (`LECRECT*` pointer).
  ### 1.1.0
  - Added GOG support (see installation note).
  - Added Steam Deck support (see installation note).
  - Improved initialization stability with better logging for errors.
  ### 1.0.0
  - Initial release.

## Limitations

* Doesn't allow for upscaling videos, yet. This includes full cutscenes and scenes that use video as part of the background/foreground (however most animations are simply a series of images, which can be upscaled).
* Doesn't attempt to make the game 16:9. Any non-4:3 assets will still look stretched.
* A full playthrough with grimmod has been completed but as new software, bugs and crashes are to be expected. Save regularly (but autosave is a potential future feature!).

## Config

Create a `grimmod.toml` file beside the game binary (`glu32.dll` on Windows, in `Contents/Resources/` on macOS) to tweak options:

| Setting                               | Default          | Effect |
| ------------------------------------- | ---------------- | ------ |
| `mods = true/false`                   | true             | Enable/disable the loading of mods |
| `renderer.hq_assets = true/false`     | true             | Enable/disable hooking the renderer to load modern image formats (PNG/VP9 MKV) from mods |
| `renderer.quick_toggle = true/false`  | true             | Enable for instant toggling between the Original/Remastered renderers, disable to restore the smooth transition |
| `renderer.video_cutouts = true/false` | true             | Some scenes use videos, which are not yet upscalable with GrimMod, as the entire background image. This option allows GrimMod to manually carve out static chunks of the video, exposing the background underneath. As a somewhat hacky solution it has been given its own toggle if issues pop up. |
| `display.vsync = true/false`          | true             | Enable/disable forced VSync |
| `display.hdpi_fix = true/false`       | true             | GrimMod rewrites some of the window handling to always render at native resolution. |
| `logging.enabled = true/false`        | true             | Enable/disable creation of and writing to `grimmod.log` with simple logging info, mostly for the purposes of a health check. |
| `logging.debug = true/false`          | false            | Enable/disable debug logging. This outputs a lot of information per frame, useless outside of debugging/development. |
| `logging.profile = true/false`        | false            | Enable/disable per-frame performance profiling. Logs hook timing data every 120 frames. |

## Building

The project requires Rust Nightly (uses `#![feature(fn_traits, tuple_trait, unboxed_closures)]`) and libvpx.

libvpx can be linked **statically** (recommended for distribution — produces a self-contained binary with no runtime dependencies) or **dynamically** (simpler for development but the target machine must have a matching libvpx installed). Static linking is controlled via the `VPX_STATIC=1` environment variable along with `VPX_LIB_DIR`, `VPX_INCLUDE_DIR`, and `VPX_VERSION`. Dynamic linking uses `pkg-config` to find libvpx automatically.

### Windows

```bash
cargo +nightly build --release --target i686-pc-windows-msvc
```

The output is `target/i686-pc-windows-msvc/release/grimmod.dll`, which should be renamed to `glu32.dll` for deployment.

### macOS

The macOS build targets 64-bit x86_64 (`x86_64-apple-darwin`) and requires `libvpx`. The game binary is x86_64, so on Apple Silicon the build must cross-compile and the game runs under Rosetta 2.

**Static linking (recommended)** — produces a self-contained dylib with no external dependencies, portable to any Mac:

On a native x86_64 Mac with Homebrew:
```bash
brew install libvpx pkg-config
VPX_LIB_DIR=$(brew --prefix libvpx)/lib \
  VPX_INCLUDE_DIR=$(brew --prefix libvpx)/include \
  VPX_VERSION=$(pkg-config --modversion vpx) \
  VPX_STATIC=1 \
  cargo +nightly build --release
```

On Apple Silicon, cross-compile against a local x86_64 libvpx build:
```bash
git clone https://chromium.googlesource.com/webm/libvpx
cd libvpx
git checkout v1.16.0
mkdir build-x86_64 && cd build-x86_64
CROSS=x86_64-apple-darwin ../configure --target=x86_64-darwin20-gcc \
  --disable-examples --disable-tools --disable-unit-tests \
  --enable-static --disable-shared --prefix=/tmp/libvpx-x86_64
make -j$(sysctl -n hw.ncpu) && make install
```

Then build with static linking:
```bash
rustup +nightly target add x86_64-apple-darwin
VPX_LIB_DIR=/tmp/libvpx-x86_64/lib \
  VPX_INCLUDE_DIR=/tmp/libvpx-x86_64/include \
  VPX_VERSION=1.16.0 \
  VPX_STATIC=1 \
  cargo +nightly build --release --target x86_64-apple-darwin
```

**Dynamic linking** — links against a system libvpx (the target machine must have the same libvpx version installed):
```bash
rustup +nightly target add x86_64-apple-darwin
PKG_CONFIG_ALLOW_CROSS=1 PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/tmp/libvpx-x86_64/lib/pkgconfig \
  cargo +nightly build --release --target x86_64-apple-darwin
```

The output is `target/x86_64-apple-darwin/release/libgrimmod.dylib` (or `target/release/libgrimmod.dylib` on a native x86_64 Mac).

## Architecture

GrimMod works by hooking game functions at runtime to intercept asset loading and rendering calls.

- **Windows**: Injected as a DLL proxy (`glu32.dll`). Uses `retour` for inline function hooking, IAT overwriting for indirect hooks, and `lightningscanner` for byte-pattern scanning to locate game functions.
- **macOS**: Injected via `DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES`. Uses inline x86-64 prologue patching with MAP_JIT trampolines for direct hooks, Mach-O lazy/non-lazy symbol pointer overwriting for indirect hooks, and Mach-O nlist/LC_SYMTAB parsing (via `goblin`) with `dlsym` for symbol resolution. Requires re-signing the game binary with entitlements to allow library injection. The macOS binary is 64-bit x86_64 (vs 32-bit i386 on Windows), requiring adjusted struct layouts for all pointer-containing engine structs.
